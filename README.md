# QA Workshop — Build Your First Wix App

A hands-on workshop for QA Engineers to build their first Wix application: a To-Do List Manager.

## Workshop Goal

By the end of this workshop, you will have a working Wix app that lets users create, manage, and track their to-do items — built and deployed on the Wix platform.

## Prerequisites

- Wix account (free tier is sufficient)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Node.js installed (v18+)

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up a Wix app project from scratch
- Working with the Wix CLI and dev environment
- Building UI components for a to-do list
- Managing data with Wix collections
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for to-do items
- Deploying and testing your app

## App Features

The To-Do List Manager will include:

- **Add tasks** — create new to-do items with a title and description
- **View tasks** — display all tasks in a list
- **Mark complete** — toggle tasks as done/undone
- **Delete tasks** — remove tasks from the list
- **Filter** — view all, active, or completed tasks
